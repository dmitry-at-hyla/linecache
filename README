OPTIONS

       -n cache-capacity

              All cache lines exceeding  this  number  will  be  removed  from
              cache.  Default cache capacity is 10 lines.

       --clean
       -c     Clean  the cache. Remove all lines from the cache, so it will be
              empty.

       --show
       -s     Show the cache. List all lines of the cache, last on the top.

FILES
       ~/.linecache
              Default cache file.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME
              linecache needs $HOME variable to find default cache file.

       Show cache.
       linecache [-f filename] -s

       Clean cache.
